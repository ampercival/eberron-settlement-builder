	- Highlight Secret and Hidden Information: Include town secrets, who knows them, and how players can uncover them.
	- Outline DC Checks: Provide skill check difficulties for challenges (e.g., Investigation, Insight, Arcana).
	- Roleplaying Tips: Include dialogue cues, behavior, and body language for key NPCs.
	- Complications or Twists: Add potential betrayals, escalating conflicts, or arcane mishaps.
	- Random Encounters: Create tables for unexpected events or social, environmental, or combat encounters.
